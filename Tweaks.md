# Tweaks
RLSwordigo adds a lot of Tweaks and Modifications to the game. This page will show you all the unlisted tweaks of RLSwordigo!

## Parkour
RLSwordigo adds a Parkour in The Plains 1 i.e The Plains after Cairnwood Village. You will also get these items as a prize for completing the parkour:
- 3 Red Soul Shards
- 4 XP Sacks
- 5 Yellow Soul Shards

## RNG Enemies
Randomly generating enemies is a system that spawns random enemies. This system is responsible for spawning all the enemies around you when you first enter an area.

The list of enemies include: `bat`, `cavelurker`, `woodblock`, `firegolem`, `spikebouncy`, `grasswalker`, `snart`, `snort`, `sprit`, `shadowblob`, `bladeblob`

## Red Mageblade
Perhaps a useless tweak, but the Mageblade is now Red!

## Platform Realism
Originally, Platforms are only supposed to fall if the player steps on them, but in RLSwordigo, any object can trigger dropping platforms to drop!
