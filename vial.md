# The Vial System
The Vial System is the system which gives you extra healing when you heal from health orbs or armor.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Vial System has been delayed and is not in 3.5. It is expected to come in RLSwordigo 4.0.

## Instructions
At default, your vial is 0. So, you will get 0 extra healing and as a result, [Ring of Vitality](Baubles.md) would not work because 0*2 = 0.

### How to upgrade your vial?
- Reach Greyhedge Village.
- Go to the Greyhedge Shop.
- Buy the Healing Potion.
- Your vial will be now increased by 1.

### How to view your vial?
- Reach Greyhedge Village.
- Go to the Healer of Greyhedge.
- The Healer will tell you your vial and instructions on upgrading it.

## Doubling your vial.
As said earlier, the [Ring of Vitality](Baubles.md) doubles your vial.\
You can obtain the Ring of Vitality by defeating the Boss of Florennum i.e Overseer without taking any damage.
