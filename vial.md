# The Vial System
The Vial System is the system which gives you extra healing when you heal from health orbs or armor.

## Instructions
At default, your vial is 0. So, you will get 0 extra healing and as a result, [Ring of Vitality](Baubles.md) would not work because 0*2 = 0.

### How to upgrade your vial?
- Reach Greyhedge Village.
- Go to the Greyhedge Shop.
- Buy the Healing Potion.
- Your vial will be now increased by 1.

### How to view your vial?
- After you buy it, it shows you the popup notification with your vial in it.
- You can eyesight it by just seeing your Vitality Ring's size, if it's not showing then you have 0 vial, if it's little, you have 1 vial, if it's average, you have 2 vial, if it's very big then you have the max i.e. 3 vial.

## Doubling your vial.
As said earlier, the [Ring of Vitality](Baubles.md) doubles your vial.\
You can obtain the Ring of Vitality by defeating the Boss of Florennum i.e Overseer without taking any damage.

## How does the Vial System work?
The Vial System basically makes it so that you gain more extra health upon picking up health orbs or healing from armor.

For example, if you have 1 vial then you'll gain 1 extra health upon picking up health orbs or healing from armor.
