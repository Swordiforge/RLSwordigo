# Time System
The Time System is a system which adds time, day, and night!

Everytime you enter a new scene, the time goes up by one hour.

## Day-time (6-18) 
The Daytime is between 6 to 18, it is pretty normal during daytime, and hey you even get a "Good Morning" message at day!

## Night-time
### Postnight
At Night, (19-24), Areas get darker, and the bed in Hiro's house becomes interactable. You should probably sleep before it gets... *too late*.

### Midnight
At Night, (0-5), Areas get even darker, and enemies start spawning around. It is the time true nightmare takes place. You should've slept earlier.

## Sleeping
RLSwordigo adds a Sleeping mechanic, to save you from the chaos that happens at midnight.

To sleep, you can navigate your way to Cairnwood Village, then to Hiro's house, and the bed should be interactable. 
> [!NOTE]
> You can only sleep between 19-5.
